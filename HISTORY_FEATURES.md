# History Screen Features

## Overview
The History screen has been completely redesigned to provide a comprehensive calendar-based view of punch records with full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality.

## Key Features

### 1. Calendar View
- **Interactive Calendar**: Uses `react-native-calendars` for a beautiful, interactive calendar interface
- **Visual Indicators**: 
  - Green dots: Completed days (with both punch-in and punch-out)
  - Yellow dots: In-progress days (punch-in only)
  - Blue highlight: Currently selected date
- **Date Selection**: Tap any date to view punch records for that specific day

### 2. Punch Record Display
- **Detailed View**: Shows punch-in time, punch-out time, total hours, and notes
- **Status Indicators**: Visual status indicators (completed, in-progress, no data)
- **Edit Functionality**: Tap the edit icon to modify any punch record

### 3. Edit Modal
- **Time Editing**: Edit punch-in and punch-out times with 24-hour format validation
- **Notes Support**: Add or edit notes for each punch record
- **Real-time Calculation**: Automatically calculates total hours as you edit times
- **Validation**: Ensures punch-out time is after punch-in time
- **Delete Option**: Remove punch records with confirmation

### 4. Data Persistence
- **AsyncStorage**: All punch data is stored locally using AsyncStorage
- **CRUD Operations**: Full create, read, update, and delete functionality
- **Data Integrity**: Proper error handling and data validation

### 5. User Experience
- **Pull to Refresh**: Swipe down to refresh data
- **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators and error handling
- **Empty States**: Helpful messages when no data is available
- **Sample Data**: Option to load sample data for testing
