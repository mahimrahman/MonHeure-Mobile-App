## üîß Configuration Files

### Babel Configuration (`babel.config.js`)
```javascript
module.exports = function (api) {
  api.cache(true);
  return {
    presets: ['babel-preset-expo'],
    plugins: [
      'nativewind/babel',
      'react-native-reanimated/plugin',
      'expo-router/babel',
    ],
  };
};
```

### Metro Configuration (`metro.config.js`)
```javascript
const { getDefaultConfig } = require('expo/metro-config');

const config = getDefaultConfig(__dirname);

// Add support for native modules
config.resolver.platforms = ['ios', 'android', 'native', 'web'];

// Add support for NativeWind
config.resolver.sourceExts.push('css');

module.exports = config;
```

### Tailwind Configuration (`tailwind.config.js`)
```javascript
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: ["./app/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}", "./screens/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}", "./components/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}"],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Metro bundler errors**
   ```bash
   npx expo start --clear
   ```

2. **NativeWind styles not working**
   - Ensure `global.css` is imported in `_layout.tsx`
   - Check `babel.config.js` has `nativewind/babel` plugin
   - Verify `tailwind.config.js` content paths

3. **Reanimated animations not working**
   - Ensure `react-native-reanimated/plugin` is in babel config
   - Restart the development server

4. **SQLite database issues**
   - Check database initialization in `punchStore.ts`
   - Verify table creation scripts

5. **PDF generation errors**
   - Ensure `react-native-html-to-pdf` is properly installed
   - Check file permissions on device

6. **Performance issues**
   - Clear Metro cache: `npx expo start --clear`
   - Restart development server
   - Check for memory leaks in animations
   - Verify all `useCallback` and `useMemo` dependencies

### Development Tips

- Use Expo DevTools for debugging
- Enable React Native Debugger for better debugging
- Use TypeScript strict mode for better code quality
- Test on both iOS and Android regularly
- Clear cache when experiencing unexpected behavior
- Monitor performance with React DevTools Profiler
- Use `console.log` sparingly in production builds
